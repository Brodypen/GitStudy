## Features

### :bust_in_silhouette: User Authentication
Users can create an account, log in, and manage their profile with Google or GitHub.

### :books: Study Groups
Users can create and join study groups. Each study group has a dedicated page where members can share resources, discuss topics, and collaborate on projects.

### :link: Resource Sharing
Users can share resources such as links to helpful articles, videos, and other educational materials. These resources can be shared within a specific study group or made public for all users to access.

### :hammer_and_wrench: Project Collaboration
Users can collaborate on projects within their study groups. This includes creating a project, assigning tasks, tracking progress, and sharing project files.

### :mag: Search
Users can search for study groups, resources, and other users. The search feature includes filters to help users find exactly what they are looking for.

## ðŸš§: Future Plans
We plan to enhance the notification system to provide more personalized and relevant updates to users.

### :star: Gamification
In the future, we plan to introduce a gamification system where users can "star" resources shared by others. This will increase the "credibility" stat of the users who consistently provide valuable resources to their community.

### :bell: Notifications
Users receive notifications about updates in their study groups, such as new resources being shared, new discussions being started, or changes to projects they are part of.
